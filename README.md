# Job Simulation Workshop - TATA âš¡

This repository contains the work I completed during a job simulation workshop conducted by TATA. The focus of this workshop was on understanding and applying key concepts of data cleaning and data visualization. ðŸ“ˆðŸ’¸

## About the Workshop
The job simulation workshop aimed to provide hands-on experience with real-world data challenges. Participants were tasked with cleaning messy datasets and creating insightful visualizations to derive meaningful conclusions.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating meaningful visualizations to communicate insights effectively using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Technologies Used
- Power BI
